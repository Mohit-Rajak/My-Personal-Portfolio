          <p>
            I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My expertise lies in creating dynamic, responsive, and scalable web applications using a variety of technologies. On the front-end, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular to build user-friendly interfaces. On the back-end, I am proficient in Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL, enabling me to develop robust and efficient server-side solutions.
My journey as a developer has been driven by a desire to solve problems, continuously learn new technologies, and create meaningful digital experiences. I am experienced in working with RESTful APIs, integrating third-party services, and implementing authentication and security measures to ensure smooth and secure user interactions.
I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy turning ideas into fully functional web applications. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and always striving to improve both the user experience and application performance. As a Full Stack Developer, I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative projects.

          <div class="topic">Why i am choese to development ? </div>
          <p>From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how things work. The ability to create something from scratch, whether it's a website, an app, or a software program, has always been exciting to me. This curiosity led me to discover the world of development—a field that seamlessly blends problem-solving, creativity, and innovation.
            Software development allows me to turn ideas into reality. I’m constantly learning new programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and I love the challenge of solving complex problems with code. Whether it’s designing a user-friendly interface, building efficient back-end systems, or working with databases, each aspect of development offers unique challenges and opportunities to grow. 
            What excites me most about development is its impact. Through code, I can create applications that improve productivity, enhance user experiences, and even change the way people live and work. There’s a deep sense of satisfaction in seeing my work come to life and knowing that it serves a purpose.</p>
